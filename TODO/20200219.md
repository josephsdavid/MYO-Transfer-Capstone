## Baselines

- [ ] traditional feature extraction
  - [ ] wave length
  - [ ] signal power
  - [ ] (see others)
  - [ ] PCA

## Our Model

- [ ] Window Size
- [ ] Data Augmentation
  - [ ] Simple/fast sequencifying
- [ ] Simple ffw (attention, dense, dropout)
- [ ] RNN
  - [ ] Depth vs width
  - [ ] Mish vs Relu
  - [ ] GRU vs LSTM
  - [ ] Learning schedules (ranger, adam, rmsprop, momentum)
  - [ ] w/ w/o layer infront of rnn
  - [ ] w/ w/o skips
- [ ] CNN
- [ ] Multi-Task

## Evaluations

- [ ] Evaluation functions
  - [ ] load model (locally not on MF)
  - [ ] run on validation data
- [ ] plot acc and loss training
- [ ] Plot learning rates
- [ ] plot performance vs batch size
- [ ] plot performance vs #params (maybe, table)
- [ ] standard text output of training results
- [ ] Confusion Matrix
- [ ] Bar plot of class accuracy
- [ ] standard text output of eval results
  - [ ] TP TN FP FN
  - [ ] Figure out best catagorical evaluation scores?

\section{Introduction}
Electrophysiological studies of the nervous system are the core area of research in clinical neurophysiology, where scientists attempt to link electrical signals from the body to real world effects. These studies include measuring brain waves (electroencephalography), comparison of sensory stimuli to electrical signals in the central nervous system (evoked potential), and the measure of electrical signals in skeletal muscles (electromyography). 
Electromyography is of particular interest to this paper. The nervous system uses electrical signals to communicate with the rest of the body. When a signal from the nervous system reaches a skeletal muscle, the myocites (muscle cells) contract, causing a physical motion. By measuring these electrical signals in a supervised manner, we can develop a link between signal and physical action. This connection yields many powerful uses, ranging from quantifying physical veracity to diagnosing neurodegenerative diseases. An example of the latter can be found in Akhmadeev et al. \cite{graves}, where electromyographic (EMG) signals were used to classify Multiple Sclerosis patients from healthy control subjects with 82\% accuracy.

Deep learning can be used to further improve the power and utility of the EMG analysis. A deep neural network is, in essence, a composition of neurons (regressors) that learns a functional mapping between two sets of data. By learning a mapping between EMG signal and physical effect, we can develop more sensitive and accurate models of what connects the two. This also allows us to use less intrusive measurement devices in studies and in the real world. The applications of this range from clinical trials and prognostication of neuromuscular diseases to gesture prediction in "brain-controlled" prosthetic limbs.

%Although deep learning is a powerful tool which can revolutionize the field of EMG study, there are several issues with the current state of research. First, the results of the latest research are difficult to compare and can be misleading, due to a lack of standards for model evaluation. Models are often evaluated on different subsets of the same dataset, making comparison impossible.  The results are also often misleading due to significant overfitting of the test subjects \cite{systematic}. 

There are several factors which need to be considered in order to develop practically useful deep learning models for real time gesture prediction (myoelectric control)\footnote{Myoelectric control in this context means classifying a gesture well before it is completed, using myoelectrographic signals. These predictions need to be done fast enough for the user to feel that the gesture is being made as they decide to complete it.}. Arguably the most important of these is the amount of time before the model makes its first prediction (referred to as "prediction latency"). 
The absolute largest prediction latency for a model to be considered useful for myoelectric control lies between 250 and 300 milliseconds  \cite{300ms}, \cite{250ms}. Many recent papers claim excellent gesture prediction results, however they require time samples (windows) between 0.5 and 1.5 seconds long \cite{rnn_1000}, \cite{rnn_128}. In this paper, all windows are 260 milliseconds in length, following the precedent set by Allard et al. \cite{primary}. This leaves 40 milliseconds for any transformations done on the window, as well as the amount of time it takes for the model to make a prediction.


The next factor to consider when designing a model for myoelectric control is the number of gestures the model is actually capable of predicting. In many recent papers, models are evaluated using between six and eight gestures. This presents an interesting theoretical result, but does not hold much practical value. Thus, we evaluate our model on 53 gestures within 3 subclasses: 12 fine finger movements, 17 wrist movements, 23 functional movements (such as grasping), and rest (present in all subclasses). 

It is also important to account for data collection. As the intention of this research is to provide a practical myoelectric control tool for mass use in real hardware (prosthetic limbs, robotic arms, etc.), we elected to use a cheap sEMG sensor, the Thalmic MYO armband (referred to as "MYO armband") \cite{myo}. The MYO armband collects data at a relatively low frequency, however it costs about \$100 and has several other qualities which make it an ideal tool for this research. The most important of these qualities is standardization. In clinical sEMG research, sensors are placed on a per patient basis in exact locations, determined by medical professionals. This is not feasible in the case of prosthetics, as requiring a doctor be present to put your hand on every day would be far from convenient. In contrast, the MYO armband automatically contracts to more or less the same points on every arm. This makes it far more practical, and it far simpler to imply the model will generalize to more subjects.

The final two factors to consider with respect to model and experimental design are related to the evaluation and generalization of the model. A myoelectric control model needs to bear two qualities: robustness over time and generalizability from subject to subject. Over time, the armband will shift, the user will become fatigued, and actions will change. For a model to be useful for mass production in prosthetics and robotic arms, it will also need to work on new people. While it is possible to train a model on a new person, even on amputees, it is preferable for the model to work immediately \cite{amputeedb}.

In this paper, we propose a novel recurrent model, which classifies 53 gestures. We train and evaluate the model on both a per repetition (robustness over time) and a per subject (generalizability) basis. With this, we also present a procedure for dealing with class imbalance in myoelectric data, a novel data augmentation technique, and a variety of preprocessing techniques. We also propose the usage of the 5th NinaPro MYO database as a standard benchmark dataset for myoelectric control \cite{nina5}. A common benchmark dataset will help current results be easily comparable, which is a large issue facing myoelectric control today. Our evaluation procedures will also help evaluate the issues brought up in \cite{systematic}, in which practical results do not match theoretical results due to overfitting.
%Although deep learning is a powerful tool which can revolutionize the field of EMG study, there are several issues with the current state of research.

Models are often evaluated on different subsets of the same dataset, making comparison impossible.  The results are also often misleading due to significant overfitting of the test subjects \cite{systematic}.

%One factor which yields excellent theoretical results but little practical value is improper model and training parameters. A major offender in this regard is improper selection of sequence length for classification. Smaller EMG sequences are harder to correctly classify and easier to overfit. The use for many EMG classifiers in recent research is gesture recognition and prediction in embedded hardware. For this purpose, the absolute limit of time sequence length is between 250 and 300 milliseconds  \cite{300ms}, \cite{250ms}. However, many recent papers, such as \cite{rnn_1000} and \cite{rnn_128}, present networks which need input sequences three to five times longer than this maximum. These models are accurate, but not useful in practice. Other research focuses on expensive high-frequency sensors, which are both less accessible and less standardized.
%
%Deep learning requires a massive amount of training data. This presents a significant challenge in the EMG space, due to lack of test subjects \cite{systematic}. Therefore,  augmenting training data is a best practice. Despite this, there is no comprehensive evaluation of EMG data augmentation practices. Similarly, there exist a wide array of data preprocessing methods for EMG signals, which are not yet standardized.
%
%
%In this paper, we will address these issues as follows. First, we will comprehensively evaluate current "best practice" preprocessing procedures on an array of standard models: a convolutional neural net (CNN), a recurrent neural net (RNN), a convolutional recurrent neural net (CRNN), and a standard feed forward deep neural network (DNN). We will evaluate data augmentation techniques in a similar manner. To  address the lack of repeatability and comparability of models, we propose a new evaluation procedure and standardize the evaluation dataset. All models will be trained and evaluated both on an intra-subject basis and an inter-subject basis. Intra-subject evaluation demonstrates that the model is robust to elements such as muscle fatigue. In contrast, inter-subject evaluation demonstrates that a model is capable of generalizing to new people \cite{ring_2018}. We also propose a standard evaluation set for low frequency EMG classification: the NinaPro5 database \cite{nina5}. The NinaPro5 database contains 52 gestures collected 6 times each at 200 Hz by 10 subject, split into three subsets of 12, 17, and 23 classes. We propose to evaluate models on each subset separately and then on all subsets combined, with both intra-subject and inter-subject evaluation.
%
%Finally, we present a novel RNN-based model architecture.  The model is small enough to make fast gesture predictions in embedded hardware, and uses appropriate size time windows. We also highlight the power of deep transfer learning by making this model more generalizable. This represents the first recurrent model with such capabilities. In the following sections, we discuss EMG signal processing, filtering, feature extraction, augmentation, and modeling procedures, providing a proper background and precedent for our research.

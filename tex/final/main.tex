\begin{abstract}
This paper presents a novel method for fast classification of sEMG signals, using a simple model of attention. On a difficult, industry benchmark sEMG dataset, the proposed method yields excellent results, classifying 36 more gestures with about 20\% higher accuracy than the current standards in the field. These results have direct and immediate application in the fields of robotics, myoelctric control, and prosthetics.
